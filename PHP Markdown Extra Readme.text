PHP Markdown Extra
==================

Version 1.1.2 - Wed 7 Feb 2007

by Michel Fortin

based on Markdown by John Gruber  
<http://daringfireball.net/>


Introduction
------------

This is a special version of PHP Markdown with extra features. See
<http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/> for details.

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

"Markdown" is two things: a plain text markup syntax, and a software 
tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text markup to HTML. 
PHP Markdown is a port to PHP of the original Markdown program by 
John Gruber.

PHP Markdown can work as a plug-in for WordPress and bBlog, as a 
modifier for the Smarty templating engine, or as a remplacement for
textile formatting in any software that support textile.

Full documentation of Markdown's syntax is available on John's 
Markdown page: <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>


Installation and Requirement
----------------------------

PHP Markdown requires PHP version 4.0.5 or later.


### WordPress ###

PHP Markdown works with [WordPress][wp], version 1.2 or later. 
PHP Markdown is already bundled with WordPress. Still, you can find 
here the latest version that may be newer than the latest WordPress 
version.

 [wp]: http://wordpress.org/

1.  To use PHP Markdown with WordPress, place the "makrdown.php" file 
    in the "plugins" folder. This folder is located inside 
    "wp-content" at the root of your site:

        (site home)/wp-content/plugins/

2.  Activate the plugin with the administrative interface of 
    WordPress. In the "Plugins" section you will now find Markdown. 
    To activate the plugin, click on the "Activate" button on the 
    same line than Markdown. Your entries will now be formatted by 
    PHP Markdown.

3.  To post Markdown content, you'll first have to disable the 
	"visual" editor in the User section of WordPress.

You can configure PHP Markdown to not apply to the comments on your 
WordPress weblog. See the "Configuration" section below.

It is not possible at this time to apply a different set of 
filters to different entries. All your entries will be formated by 
PHP Markdown. This is a limitation of WordPress. If your old entries 
are written in HTML (as opposed to another formatting syntax, like 
Textile), they'll probably stay fine after installing Markdown.


### bBlog ###

PHP Markdown also works with [bBlog][bb].

 [bb]: http://www.bblog.com/

To use PHP Markdown with bBlog, rename "markdown.php" to 
"modifier.markdown.php" and place the file in the "bBlog_plugins" 
folder. This folder is located inside the "bblog" directory of 
your site, like this:

        (site home)/bblog/bBlog_plugins/modifier.markdown.php

Select "Markdown" as the "Entry Modifier" when you post a new 
entry. This setting will only apply to the entry you are editing.


### Replacing Textile in TextPattern ###

[TextPattern][tp] use [Textile][tx] to format your text. You can 
replace Textile by Markdown in TextPattern without having to change
any code by using the *Texitle Compatibility Mode*. This may work 
with other software that expect Textile too.

 [tx]: http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/
 [tp]: http://www.textpattern.com/

1.  Rename the "markdown.php" file to "classTextile.php". This will
	make PHP Markdown behave as if it was the actual Textile parser.

2.  Replace the "classTextile.php" file TextPattern installed in your
	web directory. It can be found in the "lib" directory:

		(site home)/textpattern/lib/

Contrary to Textile, Markdown does not convert quotes to curly ones 
and does not convert multiple hyphens (`--` and `---`) into en- and 
em-dashes. If you use PHP Markdown in Textile Compatibility Mode, you 
can solve this problem by installing the "smartypants.php" file from 
[PHP SmartyPants][psp] beside the "classTextile.php" file. The Textile 
Compatibility Mode function will use SmartyPants automatically without 
further modification.

 [psp]: http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-smartypants/


### In Your Own Programs ###

You can use PHP Markdown easily in your current PHP program. Simply 
include the file and then call the Markdown function on the text you 
want to convert:

    include_once "markdown.php";
    $my_html = Markdown($my_text);

If you wish to use PHP Markdown with another text filter function 
built to parse HTML, you should filter the text *after* the Markdown
function call. This is an example with [PHP SmartyPants][psp]:

    $my_html = SmartyPants(Markdown($my_text));


### With Smarty ###

If your program use the [Smarty][sm] template engine, PHP Markdown 
can now be used as a modifier for your templates. Rename "markdown.php" 
to "modifier.markdown.php" and put it in your smarty plugins folder.

  [sm]: http://smarty.php.net/

If you are using MovableType 3.1 or later, the Smarty plugin folder is 
located at `(MT CGI root)/php/extlib/smarty/plugins`. This will allow 
Markdown to work on dynamic pages.


### Updating Markdown in Other Programs ###

Many web applications now ship with PHP Markdown, or have plugins to 
perform the conversion to HTML. You can update PHP Markdown -- or 
replace it with PHP Markdown Extra -- in many of these programs by 
swapping the old "markdown.php" file for the new one.

Here is a short non-exhaustive list of some programs and where they 
hide the "markdown.php" file.

| Program   | Path to Markdown
| -------   | ----------------
| [Pivot][] | `(site home)/pivot/includes/markdown/`

If you're unsure if you can do this with your application, ask the 
developer, or wait for the developer to update his application or 
plugin with the new version of PHP Markdown.

Configuration
-------------

By default, PHP Markdown produces XHTML output for tags with empty 
elements. E.g.:

    <br />

Markdown can be configured to produce HTML-style tags; e.g.:

    <br>

To do this, you  must edit the "MARKDOWN_EMPTY_ELEMENT_SUFFIX" 
definition below the "Global default settings" header at the start of 
the "markdown.php" file.


### WordPress-Specific Settings ###

By default, the Markdown plugin applies to both posts and comments on 
your WordPress weblog. To deactivate one or the other, edit the 
`MARKDOWN_WP_POSTS` or `MARKDOWN_WP_COMMENTS` definitions under the 
"WordPress settings" header at the start of the "markdown.php" file.

Version History
---------------

Extra 1.1.2 (7 Feb 2007)

*	Fixed an issue where headers preceded too closely by a paragraph 
	(with no blank line separating them) where put inside the paragraph.

*	Added the missing TextileRestricted method that was added to regular
	PHP Markdown since 1.0.1d but which I forgot to add to Extra.


1.0.1f (7 Feb 2007):

*	Fixed an issue with WordPress where manually-entered excerpts, but 
	not the auto-generated ones, would contain nested paragraphs.

*	Fixed an issue introduced in 1.0.1d where headers and blockquotes 
	preceded too closely by a paragraph (not separated by a blank line) 
	where incorrectly put inside the paragraph.

*	Fixed an issue introduced in 1.0.1d in the tokenizeHTML method where 
	two consecutive code spans would be merged into one when together they 
	form a valid tag in a multiline paragraph.

*	Fixed an long-prevailing issue where blank lines in code blocks would 
	be doubled when the code block is in a list item.
	
	This was due to the list processing functions relying on artificially 
	doubled blank lines to correctly determine when list items should 
	contain block-level content. The list item processing model was thus 
	changed to avoid the need for double blank lines.

*	Fixed an issue with `<% asp-style %>` instructions used as inline 
	content where the opening `<` was encoded as `&lt;`.

*	Fixed a parse error occuring when PHP is configured to accept 
	ASP-style delimiters as boundaries for PHP scripts.

*	Fixed a bug introduced in 1.0.1d where underscores in automatic links
	got swapped with emphasis tags.


Extra 1.1.1 (28 Dec 2006)

*	Fixed a problem where whitespace at the end of the line of an atx-style
	header would cause tailing `#` to appear as part of the header's content.
	This was caused by a small error in the regex that handles the definition
	for the id attribute in PHP Markdown Extra.

*	Fixed a problem where empty abbreviations definitions would eat the 
	following line as its definition.

*	Fixed an issue with calling the Markdown parser repetitivly with text 
	containing footnotes. The footnote hashes were not reinitialized properly.


1.0.1e (28 Dec 2006)

*	Added support for internationalized domain names for email addresses in 
	automatic link. Improved the speed at which email addresses are converted 
	to entities. Thanks to Milian Wolff for his optimisations.

*	Made deterministic the conversion to entities of email addresses in 
	automatic links. This means that a given email address will always be 
	encoded the same way.

*	PHP Markdown will now use its own function to calculate the length of an 
	UTF-8 string in `detab` when `mb_strlen` is not available instead of 
	giving a fatal error.


Extra 1.1 (1 Dec 2006)

*	Added a syntax for footnotes.

*	Added an experimental syntax to define abbreviations.


1.0.1d (1 Dec 2006)

*   Fixed a bug where inline images always had an empty title attribute. The 
	title attribute is now present only when explicitly defined.

*	Link references definitions can now have an empty title, previously if the 
	title was defined but left empty the link definition was ignored. This can 
	be useful if you want an empty title attribute in images to hide the 
	tooltip in Internet Explorer.

*	Made `detab` aware of UTF-8 characters. UTF-8 multi-byte sequences are now 
	correctly mapped to one character instead of the number of bytes.

*	Fixed a small bug with WordPress where WordPress' default filter `wpautop`
	was not properly deactivated on comment text, resulting in hard line breaks
	where Markdown do not prescribes them.

*	Added a `TextileRestrited` method to the textile compatibility mode. There
	is no restriction however, as Markdown does not have a restricted mode at 
	this point. This should make PHP Markdown work again in the latest 
	versions of TextPattern.

*   Converted PHP Markdown to a object-oriented design.

*	Changed span and block gamut methods so that they loop over a 
	customizable list of methods. This makes subclassing the parser a more 
	interesting option for creating syntax extensions.

*	Also added a "document" gamut loop which can be used to hook document-level 
	methods (like for striping link definitions).

*	Changed all methods which were inserting HTML code so that they now return 
	a hashed representation of the code. New methods `hashSpan` and `hashBlock`
	are used to hash respectivly span- and block-level generated content. This 
	has a couple of significant effects:
	
	1.	It prevents invalid nesting of Markdown-generated elements which 
	    could occur occuring with constructs like `*something [link*][1]`.
	2.	It prevents problems occuring with deeply nested lists on which 
	    paragraphs were ill-formed.
	3.	It removes the need to call `hashHTMLBlocks` twice during the the 
		block gamut.
	
	Hashes are turned back to HTML prior output.

*	Made the block-level HTML parser smarter using a specially-crafted regular 
	expression capable of handling nested tags.

*	Solved backtick issues in tag attributes by rewriting the HTML tokenizer to 
	be aware of code spans. All these lines should work correctly now:
	
		<span attr='`ticks`'>bar</span>
		<span attr='``double ticks``'>bar</span>
		`<test a="` content of attribute `">`

*	Changed the parsing of HTML comments to match simply from `<!--` to `-->` 
	instead using of the more complicated SGML-style rule with paired `--`.
	This is how most browsers parse comments and how XML defines them too.

*	`<address>` has been added to the list of block-level elements and is now
	treated as an HTML block instead of being wrapped within paragraph tags.

*	Now only trim trailing newlines from code blocks, instead of trimming
	all trailing whitespace characters.

*	Fixed bug where this:

		[text](http://m.com "title" )
		
	wasn't working as expected, because the parser wasn't allowing for spaces
	before the closing paren.

*	Filthy hack to support markdown='1' in div tags.

*	_DoAutoLinks() now supports the 'dict://' URL scheme.

*	PHP- and ASP-style processor instructions are now protected as
	raw HTML blocks.

		<? ... ?>
		<% ... %>

*	Fix for escaped backticks still triggering code spans:

		There are two raw backticks here: \` and here: \`, not a code span


Extra 1.0 - 5 September 2005

*   Added support for setting the id attributes for headers like this:
	
        Header 1            {#header1}
        ========
	
        ## Header 2 ##      {#header2}
	
    This only work only for headers for now.

*   Tables will now work correctly as the first element of a definition 
    list. For example, this input:

        Term

        :   Header  | Header
            ------- | -------
            Cell    | Cell
		    
    used to produce no definition list and a table where the first 
    header was named ": Header". This is now fixed.

*   Fix for a problem where a paragraph following a table was not 
    placed between `<p>` tags.


Extra 1.0b4 - 1 August 2005

*   Fixed some issues where whitespace around HTML blocks were trigging
    empty paragraph tags.

*   Fixed an HTML block parsing issue that would cause a block element 
    following a code span or block with unmatched opening bracket to be
    placed inside a paragraph.

*   Removed some PHP notices that could appear when parsing definition
    lists and tables with PHP notice reporting flag set.


Extra 1.0b3 - 29 July 2005

*   Definition lists now require a blank line before each term. Solves
    an ambiguity where the last line of lazy-indented definitions could 
    be mistaken by PHP Markdown as a new term in the list.

*   Definition lists now support multiple terms per definition.

*   Some special tags were replaced in the output by their md5 hash 
    key. Things such as this now work as expected:
	
        ## Header <?php echo $number ?> ##


Extra 1.0b2 - 26 July 2005

*   Definition lists can now take two or more definitions for one term.
    This should have been the case before, but a bug prevented this 
    from working right.

*   Fixed a problem where single column table with a pipe only at the
    end where not parsed as table. Here is such a table:
	
        | header
        | ------
        | cell

*   Fixed problems with empty cells in the first column of a table with 
    no leading pipe, like this one:
	
        header | header
        ------ | ------
               | cell

*   Code spans containing pipes did not within a table. This is now 
    fixed by parsing code spans before splitting rows into cells.

*   Added the pipe character to the backlash escape character lists.

Extra 1.0b1 (25 Jun 2005)

*   First public release of PHP Markdown Extra.
